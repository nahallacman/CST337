    <h3 style="text-align: center;">CST 337 Lab 4 -- Memory Allocation
      and Initialization<br>
    </h3>
    In this lab, we will examine some of the issues related to memory
    allocation and initialization in the PIC32 and C. We will only need
    to use the simulator for this project.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lab</span><br>
    <br>
    1) Start a new project, and enter the following code (note that you
    should be able to "cut and paste"):<br>
    <br>
    // Memory Allocation and Initialization Test<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">#include &lt;xc.h&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">#include &lt;string.h&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">const char a[] = "CST 321 Lab
      4";</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">char b[]
      =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Initialized Global Var";</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">const char c[] = "Initialized
      Constant String";</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">char d[100]
      =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Initialized String Array";</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">unsigned int gc = 0; //global

    <span style="font-family: monospace;">unsigned int ge = 0x45;
      //global initialized to 0x45</span><br style="font-family:

    <br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">int main(void)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">{</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace;">unsigned int
      ic = 0x0F1E2D3C;<br>
      unsigned int id = 1;<br>
      unsigned int ie;<br>
      const unsigned int icf = 0x98765432;<br>
      static unsigned int isf = 0x67452301;<br>

    </div>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">}</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
    2) Build and (if necessary) debug the code. Open the Watch window
    and add the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight:
      bold;">sp</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;
      font-weight: bold;">fp </span>and <span style="font-family:
      monospace; font-weight: bold;">gp </span>registers. (Note that
    the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">fp </span>register









    is also known as <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight:
      bold;">s8</span>). (Note that I have seen some debug sessions
    where the watch window wasn't updating registers properly. In this
    case, the "CPU" PIC memory view will provide the values of fp, sp
    and gp). Then add all of the global and local variables defined in
    the code. To add the locals, the focus will have to be inside the
    main routine. Adding them in the order they were declared will
    probably help, as will ensuring that the properties of the string
    symbols in the watch window is ASCII. Make sure the debugger is set
    to reset and debug startup at the reset vector. Open the PIC Memory
    Views &gt; Data Memory window, right click and select "Fill Memory
    ..." to fill all of RAM (0x0000.0000 -- 0x0000.7FFF) with
    0x55555555. (Also selecting "Keep Address Range" may save you some
    time later if you have to repeat this step.) Then, reset the device.<br>
    <br>
    3) Did resetting the device change any of RAM? (Check this in the
    Data Memory Window). Record and report the virtual addresses of the
    global variables, and their initial values. (<span style="color:
      rgb(255, 0, 0);">You may have to do a "Step Into" once do get the
      watch window to update and then Reset ag</span><span style="color:
      rgb(255, 0, 0);">ain</span>). In what memory segment (Kuseg, Kseg0
    or Kseg1 and Program Flash, Boot Flash or Data Ram (see Figure 3.1
    in the Family Reference Manual)) do the global constants and the
    global variables fall?<br>
    <br>
    4) What does the simulator say the initial values of the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">sp</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">fp </span>and
    <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">gp </span>are?









    (I do not believe these are actually initialized in the processor
    itself -- after the lab is completed, you can check using actual
    hardware if you wish.) What is the address of the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">pc </span>at
    this point (just after reset)? (Look at the top line in MPLAB window
    for <span style="font-family: monospace;">pc</span>). Check that
    the pc reads 0xBFC0000. What segment of memory is this address in
    (KUseg, Kseg0 or Kseg1 and Program Flash, Boot Flash or Data Ram)?
    What is this address the address of?<br>
    <br>
    5) Use the "Step Into" key to step (about 13 times) while watching
    the the values of the <span style="font-family: monospace;
      font-weight: bold;">sp </span>and <span style="font-family:
      monospace; font-weight: bold;">gp </span>registers. The <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">sp </span>will
    change twice then the <span style="font-family: monospace;
      font-weight: bold;">gp </span>register will change twice. Record
    the final values of each of the <span style="font-family:
      monospace; font-weight: bold;">sp </span>and <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">gp </span>registers.










    What segment of memory is each of these registers pointing to
    (KUseg, Kseg0 or Kseg1 and Program Flash, Boot Flash or Data Ram)? <br>
    <br>
    6) Set a breakpoint on the opening brace at the beginning of main()
    (before any code is executed in main). Open the disassembly window
    and set the breakpoint on the first assembly instruction in main if
    it is not already there. Run to that point. Did <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">sp </span>or <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">gp </span>change?









    Which global values changed? In particular, what value was <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">gd </span>initialized







    to, even though the code did not request this? What caused all these
    variables to change?<br>
    <br>
    7) The local variables in main will no longer be "Out of scope".
    Some of them will already have their initial values. What is common
    about the type declarations of these local variables that are
    already initialized? Of these variables, some fall in Kseg0 Program
    Flash, and some in Kseg1 Data Ram. What is different about the type
    declarations of the variables that fall in Program Flash, and those
    that fall in Data Ram? When do you think each of the values were
    initialized? <br>
    <br>
    8) Click in the disassembly window and single step machine
    instructions until some of the local variables addresses change to
    different addresses. What register being assigned a value caused
    these addresses to be changed? What is another name for this
    register? Why did changing its value change the addresses the
    debugger determines for these variables? (Look at the disassembly to
    see how <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">ic
    </span>(and others of these variables) are being referenced).<br>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Skip this question, Apparently
      MPLAB changed how the debugger works this year</span>.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> In previous years the local
      variables did not get accurate addresses until after the frame
      pointer (fp or s8) was assigned since they are all referenced as
      offsets from the fp.</span><br>
    <br>
    9) Check what addresses all of these non-static (also known as
    "automatic") local variables have. What registers have values close
    to these addresses? How would we commonly refer to this section of
    RAM? Does it surprise you that even the (non-static) const local
    variables reside in RAM? What does "constant" mean in this case?<br>
    <br>
    10) Looking at the code, determine where the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">data





        used to initialize</span></span> <span style="font-family:
      monospace; font-weight: bold;">ic </span>is stored? (Note that
    you have to be careful when decoding the address from the
    disassembly listing, as sometimes part of the address is given in
    hex and part in decimal.) In what memory segment is this (KUseg,
    Kseg0 or Kseg1 and Program Flash, Boot Flash or Data Ram)?<br>
    <br>
    11) At what address is the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">data used to initialize</span></span>&nbsp;





    <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">la </span>stored?





    (Note that you have to be careful when decoding the address from the
    disassembly listing, as sometimes part of the address is given in
    hex and part in decimal.) In what memory segment is this (KUseg,
    Kseg0 or Kseg1 and Program Flash, Boot Flash or Data Ram) is this?
    In the appropriate memory window, right click and select "Go to.."
    to go to this address. Verify that the value stored at this address
    is correct. Single step through the machine code that initializes <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">la </span>while






    observing its value in the watch window. Is local string
    initialization this way a good idea? Would it be better for us to
    have used strcpy() to initialize <span style="font-weight: bold;
      font-family: monospace;">la</span>? <br>
    <br>
    12) Give the addresses for the initializers (the data used to
    initialize) for the non-constant global variables <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b[]</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">d[]</span> and
    <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">ge</span>.
    You may have to search around a bit in the Execution memory window.
    If you are observant you may already have noticed them. In what
    memory segment do they fall (KUseg, Kseg0 or Kseg1 and Program
    Flash, Boot Flash or Data Ram)? Why do you suppose that the
    addresses for the global strings <span style="font-family:
      monospace; font-weight: bold;">a[]</span>, the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b[]</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> initializer</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">c[]</span> and
    the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">d[]</span>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">initializer </span>are not
    sequential (following the order in which they were declared)?<br>
    Which approach is more memory efficient for strings like <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">a[]</span> and
    <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b[]</span>;
    to use the const declaration in as in <span style="font-family:
      monospace; font-weight: bold;">a[]</span> or not as in <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b[]</span>?
    Why? (Hint: How much total memory (Ram and Flash) is needed for <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b[]</span> and
    the data used to initialize it?) <br>
    <br>
    13) Set a breakpoint on the last strcpy() in the main program. Run
    to, then step over it while observing the global strings in the
    watch window. What is the problem with this strcpy? Where did the
    extra data go? What determines the end of a string as far as
    strcpy() is concerned? How does the debugger determine how long
    strings are for purposes of displaying them in the watch window?
    What would happen if we added a strcpy(d, b) following the last
    strcpy()? Try it, see what happens, and then <span style="font-weight: bold;">remove the added strcpy(d,b)</span>.<br>
    <br>
    14) Record the starting and ending addresses of main from the
    disassembly window. <br>
    <br>
    15)&nbsp; Create a map file for your project through Project
    Properties &gt; xc32-ld &gt; Diagnostics &gt; Generate map file then
    supply an appropriate name. Rebuild the code and then open the
    resulting map file that was stored in your project directory. Scroll
    down to the "Microchip PIC32 Memory-Usage Report" section of the map
    file. From the information in this section (don't go beyond the
    "Discarded input sections" heading), create one table for Ram and
    one for Flash showing the starting addresses and relative positions
    of each of the sections in the memory usage report. The RAM table
    should include .data, .sdata, .sbss, heap and stack sections. The
    Flash table should include .text, .rodata, .dinit, .reset,
    .bev_excpt and .app_excpt sections.&nbsp; For consistency, put low
    numbered addresses on the top of the tables. Place Kseg1 addresses
    in the table based on their corresponding Kseg0 addresses (i.e.
    Kseg1 address 0xBFC00000 maps to the same physical address as Kseg0
    address 0x9FC00000) but indicate that the section is accessed
    through Kseg1. <br>
    On or next to each of these sections show the address of each of the
    global constants and variables, static constants and variables, and
    the address of any data used to initialize another variable for all
    variables (except those whose initializer is in the main program
    itself). For the data used to initialize, also list the name of the
    variable it is used to initialize. Also indicate on the table the
    starting and ending address of main, and the address of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">top </span>of the stack (stack will be
    the bottom).<br>
    As a check, here is a list of the variables that need to appear <span style="font-weight: bold;">in</span> the tables: <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">a</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">c</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">d</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">gc</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">gd</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">ge</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">isf</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">iscf</span>,
    and <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">lcc</span>.
    Also, show the addresses of the initializers for <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">b</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">d</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">ge</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">isf</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">la</span>, and
    <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">lc</span>.
    <br>
    It might be a good idea to show your tables to the professor before
    turning then in to make sure they are in the right format and have
    all the needed elements.<br>
    <br>
    16) Where is the strcpy() routine kept in memory?<br>
    <br>
    17) From their addresses, work out what the purpose of the .reset,
    .bev_excpt .and .app_excpt sections are.<br>
    <br>
    18) Why are all the elements in Flash (except .reset and .bev_excpt)
    referenced through KSEG0 and all of the elements in RAM referenced
    through KSEG1?<br>
    <br>
    19) Add a call to malloc (void * malloc(size_t size)) to allocate
    enough memory in which to copy one of the strings. Use strcpy() to
    carry out the copy, then free the allocated space with free (void
    free(void * ptr)). You will have to turn on dynamic memory
    allocation. This is done by setting the Heap size to 512 through
    Project Properties &gt; xc32-ld &gt; General.&nbsp; Debug your code
    to make sure it works. Use the debugger to determine at what address
    this heap memory was allocated. Also add a notation to your memory
    map indicating where the for the memory for the heap would be
    allocated. if it was present. Why do the addresses of a and c change
    after making this code change?<br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
    Check the map file for the bottom of the stack segment. Did it move?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Report<br>
      <br>
    </span>Include a print out of the final version of your code and the
    data and answers to the questions posed in steps 3-19 above.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
