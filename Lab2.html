      <h3 style="text-align: center;">CST 321/337 Lab 2 -- Performance
        Issues</h3>
      <div style="text-align: left;">In this lab we will explore some of
        the factors that influence execution time performance on the
        PIC32MX. First we will need a program that takes some time to
        execute so we can observe the impact of performance
        enhancements. In this case we will use an "FFT" (a Fast Fourier
        Transform). This is a common mathematical operation that can
        convert a series of samples of the amplitude of a signal (its
        time domain representation) into a frequency domain
        representation. This is useful not only for visualizing the
        frequency domain representation of a signal, but also for many
        other functions such as digital filtering (and other DSP
        functions) and it is also used for some other numeric
        operations. The directory "<span style="font-family: monospace;">\\rei\pv104_public\CST







          337</span>" (note that there is a space in "CST 337") contains
        a directory called&nbsp; "fft" that contains a public domain
        floating-point implementation of an FFT by Don Cross. We will
        begin by porting this code to the PIC32MX.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lab<br>
          <br>
          Part 1<br>
        </span><br>
        1) Start a new project (select set as main project as you do
        this), and copy the contents of the fft directory to your
        project directory.<br>
        <br>
        2) The fft directory contains several .c and .h files related to
        the project. In particular fourierf.c contains -- fft_float() --
        the floating point FFT routine that we will use. (fourierd.c
        contains a double-precision floating point FFT fft_double()).
        FOURIER.H contains the necessary function prototypes, along with
        a good description of the arguments needed for the fft_float()
        routine:<br>

            );&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* array of output's
            imaginaries */</span><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Note that the number of samples handled by this FFT routine must
        be a power of 2. The NumSamples input tells the fft_float()
        routine how many samples it must process and hence the size of
        the input and output data arrays. For our purposes, we will be
        using a forward FFT (which transforms a time domain signal into
        the frequency domain) so we will be using 0 as the second
        argument. The "In" arrays provide for the input while the "Out"
        arrays will carry the output. Note that both of these arrays are
        pairs resulting from the fact that FFTs use complex numbers. Our
        input data will be real values only. A way to handle this
        without the need to provide an imaginary input array (of all 0
        values) is simply to pass a null pointer for the ImaginaryIn
        array. As noted in the header file, the fft_float() routine will
        recognize this as a flag that indicates the input is real. We
        will, however, need arrays for both the real and imaginary
        outputs.<br>
        <br>
        3) Add the fourierf.c source, the fftmisc.c source and a new
        (suitably named) main routine source file to your project. Add
        the necessary include files to your main source file and some
        #defines:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">#define M_PI </span><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">3.14159265358979323846<br>
          </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">#define </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">NSAMP 256</span> <span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
            #define TPIN (2 * M_PI/NSAMP)<br>
          </span></div>
        We will use NSAMP for the number of samples to process (note
        that it must be a power of 2) and TPIN (two pi over NSAMP) will
        be used to generate sinusoidal inputs for the FFT. Note that
        M_PI has the value of PI and is defined in the math library.
        Also, because we will be using sin and other math library
        functions, we will need to include &lt;math.h&gt;.<br>
        <br>
        4) Globally declare the one input (which will be a sine wave)
        and two output arrays (one for the real and one for the
        imaginary output). They need to be global for the DMCI tool that
        we will use later (otherwise they could be local). Add code to
        initialize the real input array to the following function: <span style="font-family: monospace;">in[n] = 200 * sin(f * 2 * pi
          /NSAMP * n)</span> where f is the normalized frequency of the
        sin wave and 200 will be its peak amplitude. By normalized
        frequency we mean that there will be <span style="font-family:
          monospace;">f</span> cycles of the sin wave in the input
        array. To see this, note how the argument to the sin function
        will go from 0 to 2*pi <span style="font-family: monospace;">f</span>
        times as n goes from 0 to NSAMP. (The actual frequency of the
        input would depend on our sampling frequency, and since we
        didn't actually sample it, it is somewhat arbitrary.) You can
        chose the value of <span style="font-family: monospace;">f </span>that














        you want from integer values between 2 and 8). Next add the code
        to call the fft_float() routine. Finally, we will process the
        two output arrays to get the magnitude of the FFT output. This
        is provided by the formula mag[n] = sqrt(Real[n]^2 + Imag[n]^2).
        As you may recall, imaginary numbers provide both magnitude and
        phase information. The magnitude is what we are primarily
        interested in. Rather than define a magnitude array we can
        overwrite one of the output arrays (if you do define a magnitude
        array, make it globally defined). <br>
        <br>
        5) You will need to modify fft_float() as it was defined to run
        on a general purpose machine and contains some fprints() calls
        to report errors. Note that the PIC32MX libraries do provide
        some support for using printf and scanf on the UART2 interface.
        Also, the PIC32MX starter kit supports using some I/O functions
        that allow output from a program to appear in a window in MPLAB
        and for input to be supplied back to the PIC32 when it is
        running standalone being debugged through the USB debug cable.
        Similarly, Real ICE and the 5xx/6xx/7xx members of the PIC32
        family can support this feature but not the 3xx. Since our
        configurations don't support either of these approaches, the
        fprintf() calls will have to be removed (commented out). Select
        the simulator as the debugger, and build your project. Fix any
        issues until the code builds properly. Keep a record of any
        changes you had to make to any of the fft files you are porting
        for your report.<br>
        <br>
        6) You will need to add some heap space as apparently some of
        the math library or floating point routines requires it. This
        can be done in Project Properties under the xc32-ld category.
        Allocate 512 bytes for the heap. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Skip step 7. The DMCI
          plugin doesn't currently display floating point arrays
          correctly.</span> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Instead
do






          step 7a and export the data to csv files which excel can
          graph.</span><br>
        7) To make sure the code is functioning properly, we will have
        to be able to observe the input array and the results in the
        output array. One way to do this could be to use the Watch
        window to export the input array and the magnitude output array
        to files (after running the code) and then to use an external
        graphing program (i.e. Excel) to visualize them. However, MPLAB
        also provides a tool that can present the contents of arrays
        visually. This is the DMCI or "Data Monitor and Control
        Interface". <br>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Select Tools &gt; Embedded &gt;
          DMCI &gt; DMCI Window, then Dynamic Data View. Rebuild your
          project, and then re-open the DMCI window. Select the
          appropriate project in the DMCI window. Now, you can right
          click on a graph window and choose the Configure Data Source
          option. Then select the input array from the global symbols
          list and finally, click OK. Now run the code. After running
          the code (a breakpoint at the end of main helps to know when
          you are done), you should be able to see a sin wave with
          between 2 to 8 full cycles in the graph (according to your
          choice of <span style="font-family: monospace;">f</span>) and
          an amplitude of 200.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Repeat the above steps in another graph in order to see the
        output magnitude (You only need to set the sample count to 128
        since the FFT output in the last 128 elements will be a mirror
        image of the first 128.)<br>
        Show these results to the professor.<br>
        <br>
        7a) From the Variables window export to CSV the input and final
        magnitude output arrays. Make sure they are first set to display
        the value column as IEEE float. Right click on the array name
        and choose export data to CSV. Then, chose "Displayed Format".
        Then open the csv file using excel and graph the data. On the
        magnitude output, you only need to graph half the array (so 128
        data points of the 256), as the data is mirrored. Graphing less
        will likely let you see more clearly what is going on. Show the
        graphs to your professor. Change f in the input array
        calculation and see what changes. Following is a graph of the
        input and the magnitude output for f = 8.<br>
        <img style=" width: 398px; height: 125px;" alt="" src="./Lab2_files/sin8.png">
        &nbsp; <img style=" width: 360px; height: 123px;" alt="" src="./Lab2_files/fft8.png"><br>
        Notice how there are 8 complete cycles in the input window and
        how the magnitude output has a peak at 8. Show your results to
        the professor in order to ensure your code is functioning
        correctly.<br>
        <br>
        8) Now we will add the ability to time the execution of the fft
        routine and rebuild it for the actual hardware using the Real
        ICE debugger. We will probably need a 32 bit timer (I hope that
        is big enough) so we can't use Real ICE's built in stopwatch. We
        can, however, use Timers 2 and 3 configured as a 32 bit timer.
        To do this, we need to set the T32 bit in T2CON. Once this bit
        is set and the Timer is running (T2CON.ON is set), we can read
        and write 32 bit values from the TMR2 and PR2 ports. Add code to
        initialize Timer2 (and 3 together) by setting up T2CON. Set the
        timer2 prescale for 1:1 and also set the system clock for 72MHz
        using the pragmas (introduced in the last lab), but this time
        set the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Peripheral Bus
          clock to also run at 72MHz</span>.<br>
        <br>
        9) We will use this opportunity to introduce the functions and
        macros in the PIC32MX Peripheral Library. To use these functions
        you will have to add #include &lt;plib.h&gt; to your code. The
        functions and macros are described in MPLAB under Help &gt; Help
        Contents&nbsp; &gt; Language Tools &gt; XC32 Toolchain &gt; XC32
        Peripheral Libraries. This really just only gives a listing of
        the functions and macros that are in the library and a
        rudimentary listing of the arguments. It doesn't provide a
        description of how the function or macro operates and any of its
        side effects. One useful thing this help file provides is a
        listing of which routines are functions and which are macros. A
        better description of the functions and macros can be found in
        the 32-bit-Peripheral-Library-Guide.pdf file which is in the
        class reference material on the class web page). Ultimately the
        best source is the library source itself (in include files for
        macros at eg. C:\Program
        Files\Microchip\xc32\v1.32\pic32-libs\include\peripheral\timer.h
        and in source files at eg. C:\Program
        Files\Microchip\peripheral\(appropriate peripheral)\source). <br>
        <br>
        10) Check out each of the above references looking for the
        OpenTimer23 macro so you can see what information each resource
        provides. Be careful not to make any changes to the timer.h
        file.<br>
        <br>
        11) So, we could configure and use timer 23 by placing<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">OpenTimer23(T2_ON | T2_SOURCE_INT | T2_PS_1_1,
            0)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
          <span style="font-family: monospace;"> WriteTimer23(0) //
            initialize the timer to 0</span><br>
        </div>
        immediately beofre the fft_float() routine call, and then<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">time = ReadTimer23() <br>
          </span></div>
        immediately after it.<br>
        <br>
        Alternately you can setup the 32 bit timer using your own code
        (use the timer 2 setup code you used in the last lab, adding in
        setting the T2CON.T32 bit). Once T2 is put in 32 bit mode, 32
        bit values can be read from and written to TMR2 and PR2.<br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
        <br>
        First, a word about using peripheral library routines. Always
        make sure you know what the routine does and what side effects
        it might have. Also be very aware of whether the routine is a
        macro or a function, especially when using them in interrupt
        service routines. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calling an
          actual function within a service routine adds a lot of
          overhead to the routine by itself, and also forces the service
          routine to save and restore all registers since it cannot be
          sure what registers the called routine (or any routines it
          might call) uses!</span> Also, you will note that many of
        these routines make use of parameters defined in include files
        that are not error checked so it would be easy to use, say a
        timer1 parameter (say T1_PS_1_8) where timer 2 parameter (say
        T2_PS_1_8) was actually needed which could lead to undesired
        results.<br>
        <br>
        Answer the following questions for your report: What advantages
        do the above macros provide over using the T2CON, TMR2 and PR2
        ports directly? What disadvantages are there?<br>
        <br>
        12) Build, debug and run your code using the target board
        hardware. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Make sure you
          are only timing the execution of the fft_float() routine.</span>
        Record the timer23 output, and its equivalent value in seconds
        for your report. Make sure the value makes sense by checking it
        against your observation of how long the code takes to reach a
        breakpoint set after the timer23 read. Please record the cycle
        count <span style="font-weight: bold;">in decimal</span> for
        your report. Note that you can set the properties of the "time"
        variable in the watch window so it is reported in decimal rather
        than hex. Also convert this to seconds.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lab Part 2</span><br>
        <br>
        Now we will make some changes to the PIC32MX configuration and
        record the improvements in execution time that they produce<br>
        <br>
        13) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flash Wait States</span>
        By default, the PIC32MX is configured to operate with 7 (the
        maximum number) of wait states for accessing the flash memory.
        This reset default provides a safe default for current and
        future PIC32MX family members, but will mean that the
        instructions are fetched more slowly than they might otherwise
        be on our processor. Remembering that we are running at 72MHz
        and that the flash access time is <nobr>33 1/3ns</nobr>
        (30MHz). This means that 2.4 system clock cycles are needed to
        access Flash. Since the processor always allocates one cycle for
        the load instruction, we will have to add 2 wait states. This
        can be done using the CHECON (Cache Control) register and
        setting its PFMWS (prefetch module wait states) to 2. <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">CHECONbits.PFMWS=2<br>
          </span></div>
        One might be tempted to use the macro: <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEMConfigWaitStatesAndPB(freq)</span>
        which will compute the number of wait states needed given the
        passed frequency parameter which in our case would be <span style="font-family: monospace;">72000000L</span> (note the L),
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">but </span>it also configures
        the Peripheral bus divider for its maximum clock rate -- it
        seems early PIC32s couldn't run the peripheral bus past 50MHz
        and so this macro was put in the library. In current versions of
        the library, it sets the Peripheral Bus clock divider for 1 to 1
        since the peripheral bus can operate at 80MHz. However, this
        might represent a side effect if you were setting the PB divider
        to something other than 1 to 1 in your #pragmas and then ran
        this macro. A macro in the current library that only sets the
        wait states is <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEMConfigWaitStates(freq)</span>.<br>
        <br>
        Make sure your code still functions correctly (check the Input
        and Output arrays), and record the resulting execution time in
        cycles and in seconds for your report.<br>
        <br>
        14) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Instruction Cache</span>
        Turn on the Instruction Cache using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">CheKseg0CacheOn()</span>
        macro. Leave the Wait States set to 2. Make sure your code still
        functions correctly (check the Input and Output arrays), and
        record the resulting execution time in cycles and in seconds.
        Note that the Instruction Cache is rather small (it can hold at
        most 64 32-bit instructions).<br>
        <br>
        15) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling PreFetch</span>
        The cache module can also pre-fetch instructions. When an
        instruction is fetched and it misses in the cache, that
        instruction (and its 4 neighbors) are fetched and brought into
        the cache. When instruction pre-fetch is enabled, the next 4
        instructions are also brought into the prefetch unit. If the
        code that was brought into the cache does not branch, the next
        instructions will be available in the Prefetch unit with no wait
        states. Prefetch can be turned on with the macro<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">mCheConfigure(CHECON | 0x30)<br>

        Make sure your code still functions correctly (check that the
        Input and Output arrays still have the same data), and record
        the resulting execution time in cycles and in seconds for your
        report. Also determine how this macro could be replaced with a
        CHECONbits statement like that in part 13. Use this in your code
        or put it in your report.<br>

        16) An alternative to the above 3 steps (which could themselves
        be simplified) is <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEMConfig(72000000L,














          SYS_CFG_WAIT_STATES | SYS_CFG_PCACHE)</span>. (Note that
        without the SYS_CFG_PB_BUS flag, SYSTEMConfig won't change the
        peripheral bus clock divider settings.) Change your code to use
        the SYSTEMConfig macro. Make sure your code still functions
        correctly (check the Input and Output arrays), and record the
        resulting execution time in cycles and in seconds. If the
        execution time does not match that you obtained in part 15, try
        to determine what SYSTEMConfig did differently than the settings
        it replaced.<br>
        Note: avoid using the SYSTEMConfigPerformance macro which, like
        SYSTEMConfigWaitStatesAndPB, also has the side effect of setting
        the PB clock divider to 1:1.<br>
