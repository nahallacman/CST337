    <h3 style="text-align: center;">CST 321/337 Lab 5 -- SPI Interface
      with the 25LC256</h3>
    <br>
    In this lab we will write data to and read data from the 25LC256
    32Kbyte SPI serial EEProm on the AV32 board. The EEProm is connected
    as shown below using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPI1</span>
    interface.<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 461px; height:
        167px;" alt="" src="./Lab5_files/25LC256.gif"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 1 </span><br>
    We will begin by writing a read and a write routine capable of
    reading a byte from or writing a byte to the 25LC256 respectively.
    Use a polled approach. Remember the following key points:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span>
        command that can be handled by the 25LC256 while a write is in
        progress (for up to 5ms after the end of a write) is the read
        status command.</li>
      <li>It is usually best to check status for a write in progress
        before starting a read or write operation. This way, code can be
        structured to do a 25LC256 write then go on with non-25LC256
        operations while it is busy and only have to wait for the
        previous 25LC256 write to complete when another 25LC256
        operation is needed. If there were enough intervening
        non-25LC256 operations, we might not have to wait at all.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Writes must be preceded by a write enable command.</li>
      <li>All commands must be preceded by a <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> assertion and
        followed by a <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        negation. Note that <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        is controlled through <span style="font-weight: bold;">RB10</span>
        under software control. The SPI master does not automatically
        control it. It will have to be configured for output. Before
        doing this, set the port latch for this pin to high so that when
        enabled for output, it will not be immediately asserted. If we
        enabled for output before setting the port pin latch high, we
        would probably have <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        be low for a short period of time which could cause problems
        with the 25LC256 (maybe violate a timing parameter on the
        minimum time <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        can be asserted). At the very least setting the port latch for
        this pin high before enabling it for output is safer. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Also note that PORTB defaults to analog inputs for
            the A/D converter.</span> To use RB10 you will need to first
          configure it for digital I/O using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AD1PCFG</span> sfr. (See section
          17 of the Family Reference Manual.)</span></li>
      <li>As discussed in class, we will set CKE = 0, CKP = 1, SMP = 0
        and BRG so that the SCK has a period of no less than 220ns so
        that the PIC32 and 25LC256 setup and hold times are met for data
        bits on their inputs. <br>
      </li>
      <li>As <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(will yet be)</span>
        discussed in class, the 25LC256's <span style="text-decoration:
          overline;">CS</span> to first data bit sampling requirement
        (parameter 2 - 100ns min) will be automatically met if we select
        CKE = 0 and CKP = 1.</li>
      <li>Note that after RBF, and we need to wait at least 90ns before
        <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> negation in
        order to meet the 25LC256's timing requirement 3. (This is 200ns
        after the positive edge in the middle of the last bit shifted
        out of the 25LC256 until <span style="text-decoration:
          overline;">CS</span> can be negated, but RBF is not set until
        (at the earliest) 110ns later at the next negative edge of the
        clock). As discussed in class, the additional 90ns would require
        8 SYSCLK cycles at 80MHz, and that a tightly coded RBF polling
        loop could take from 4 to 6 cycles. It is likely that
        unoptimized C polling of RBF before clearing <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> will provide the
        needed delay. (Later when we use interrupts we can note that the
        RXIF flag is set 2 Sysclks after RBF plus the interrupt latency
        will more than cover the needed time.) <br>
      </li>
      <li>The 25LC256 also has a restriction on how soon the <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> can be asserted
        again after it was negated on a previous operation. This is
        parameter #4, and for us is 50ns min, which at 80 MHz translates
        to 4 cycles. It may be possible, even in unoptimized C, that <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> could be cleared
        and then set again in less than 4 cycles so you should be
        careful to check that your code meets this requirement. </li>
    </ul>
    We want to have the commands sent to the 25LC256 to be as efficient
    as possible, so we will follow the following plan using a read
    status command as an example. (This was also discussed in class with
    the aid of a handout).<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Assert <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>.</li>
      <li>Write a read status command to the 25LC256 (write a read
        status command to SPI1BUF).</li>
      <li>Wait for TBE (transmitter buffer empty)</li>
      <li>Write a dummy data byte to SPI1BUF (we need to write a byte to
        get the SPI to clock the returned status byte in)</li>
      <li>Wait for RBF (receive buffer full) which will be set after the
        read status command is fully shifted out.</li>
      <li>Read SPI1BUF and discard the dummy data that was clocked in
        while the read status command was sent out.</li>
      <li>Wait for RBF which will be set after the dummy data byte (sent
        at step 3) is clocked out</li>
      <li>Read the status byte which was clocked in from the 25LC256
        while the dummy data byte (sent at step 3) was clocked out.</li>
      <li>Negate <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    Note that waiting for TBE (rather than RBF) after sending the the
    read status command before sending the dummy data that will clock
    the status byte in will allow this byte to start shifting out
    immediately after the read status command shifts out.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
    </span><br>
    Start out with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">processor and
      peripheral bus clock of 80 MHz</span> and a SPI clock rate of
    1MHz. Also arrange to reduce the number of wait states for RAM and
    Flash and turn on the cache using <span style="font-weight: bold;">SYSTEMConfig</span>.
    When initializing SPI1, among other things, set for CKE=0 and CKP =
    1 and SMP = 0. This mode is compatible with the 25LC256 (which
    samples data on the positive clock edge) and will meet the 25LC256's
    data setup requirement on the first data bit and also meet the
    25LC256's <span style="text-decoration: overline;"></span>parameter
    2 requirement.<br>
    <br>
    Use an incremental approach to constructing your software. For
    example you could write and test the read status sequence (it will
    likely return all 0s). Then write and test a write enable sequence
    (following a write enable with a read status should show that the
    WEL bit in status was set.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">While debugging, be aware that
      under&nbsp; MPLAB v8.76 the Real ICE did not appear to honor FRZ
      (freeze on halt) for the SPI. I haven't checked if this is also
      true of the latest version of MPLABX. This means that you will
      have to be careful where you set breakpoints. If you set a
      breakpoint after the write following the wait for TBE and before
      the dummy read after RBF, you will get an overflow because two
      values will be clocked in before we read. And, remember that once
      the SPI gets overflow set, it does not function correctly until it
      is cleared. </span><br>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
    </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demonstrate</span> to the
    professor that you can write several randomly chosen bytes of data
    to several different randomly chosen addresses and that the data
    read back in each case is the value that was written. Precede the
    write with a read at each location in order to be able to show that
    data actually changed.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      Demonstrate</span> to the professor that the write and read
    commands are sent efficiently using the Logic Analyzer or MSO (i.e.
    there is no break in the clock over the course of the read and the
    write). <br>
    <br>
    Move the SPI clock rate up so its period is as close as possible to
    220ns at a system and peripheral bus clock of 80MHz. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Verify</span> that data can be read
    and written as before. Be sure to chose different addresses and
    data.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Verify</span> the SPI clock rate.
    Report the SYSCLK rate, the PBCLK rate and the BRG value you used
    along with the actual SPI clock rate measured using the logic
    analyzer. Include these results in your report.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Verify</span> that data setup and
    hold timing requirements are met at the 25LC256 (SDO) and at the
    PIC32MX (SDI). Also check that <span style="text-decoration:
      underline;">all three</span> of the 25LC256's timing requirements
    for <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> are met. In
    each case, include the name of the timing requirement you are
    checking, its stated value and the actual values you measured for
    your report. Note that this is a total of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span> different timing
    requirements that you are checking.<br>
    Remember to report each measured value as +/- the analyzer's
    sampling rate. Also note that you should check all assertions and
    negations of CS generated by your code to find the worst case
    timing.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Determine</span>, as best you can,
    how many system clocks there are between an initial write to an <span style="font-weight: bold;">empty</span> SPI1BUF and when the TBE
    bit is set. What uncertainties are there in your results? Record
    your results, your method and identify any uncertainties for your
    report.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
    </span><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 2<br>
    </span>Now we want to manage the EEprom using an interrupt service
    routine. Note that the service routine will have to handle
    operations for checking status, enabling writes and reading and
    writing data as well as handling <span style="text-decoration:
      overline;">CS</span> assertion and negation. This will require
    that the interrupt service routine be written using a state machine
    approach so that at each interrupt the service routine can determine
    what function is to be carried out in response to to the interrupt
    based on what state the overall sequence of transfers is in at that
    point.<br>
    <br>
    Also note that we want to use the same approach as we did when
    polling, namely we want to be as efficient as possible in our
    communication with the EEProm. We do this by spacing the first two
    writes after asserting <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
    based on polling TBE. This is likely quick enough that it doesn't
    make sense to leave the service routine. (Ordinarily, polling inside
    a service routine is a very bad idea!) Thus sometimes the service
    routine will write two bytes per invocation. Other times it will
    read one byte and write one byte or just write one byte or just read
    one byte per invocation as needed to advance the sequence of
    transfers.<br>
    <br>
    We will structure the overall interface to the EEProm as a subsystem
    with two functions and a global variable designed to provide the
    user interface to the subsystem. The three functions will be<br>
    <ul>
      <li>void ReadEEProm(int nbytes, unsigned int address, unsigned
        char[] readbuffer)</li>
      <li>void WriteEEProm(int nbytes, unsigned int address, unsigned
        char[] writebufer)</li>
      <li>global int EEPromSysBusy<br>
        This global variable will be 1 if the subsystem is still busy
        with the last read or write operation and cannot start another
        one.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    The ReadEEProm() and WriteEEProm() functions should wait until
    EEPromSysBusy is a 0 before setting EEPromSysBusy and setting up
    parameters used by the service routine as appropriate and initiate
    the interrupt service routine sequence by setting the SPI1RXIF
    interrupt flag. The function will then return.&nbsp; Note that the
    ReadEEProm() and WriteEEProm() functions only begin a sequence of
    interrupts that will likely complete long after the function itself
    returns.&nbsp; The service routine will clear EEPromSysBusy in the
    final state of a given sequence. This is why each function needs to
    wait until EEPromSysBusy is a 0 before launching a new interrupt
    sequence. Also, user code needs to wait to use any data read from
    the EEProm (stored in readbuffer) until EEPromSysBusy is a 0. This
    also applies to debugging! Be aware that a breakpoint set on a line
    of code following a call to either the ReadEEProm() or WriteEEProm()
    functions will be interrupting mid sequence, possibly between RBFs
    and SPI buffer reads, which as we have seen can lead to SPI buffer
    overflows (because of our queued writes). You may want to
    temporarily add waits while EEPromSysBusy is set following function
    calls in order to provide a way to set a breakpoint that is only
    triggered when it is safe to do so. Alternately breakpoints can be
    set at appropriate points in the service routine (i.e. following <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> negation etc.).<br>
    <br>
    Also note that you may be able to make use of the read and write
    functions and other code you developed earlier in part 1 to help in
    development and debugging. <br>
    <br>
    It is also a very good idea to build up the service routine
    gradually. Begin by developing the functionality needed to support
    the WriteEEProm() function. Start by having the service routine do a
    25LC256 write-in-progress status check. With successive interrupts,
    issue the sequence of writes and reads needed to read status until
    the Status.WIP bit is cleared then clear EEPromSysBusy. This
    functionality can be tested by using the polled write function to
    start a byte write, and then start the interrupt service (perhaps
    counting the number of times it is entered so we can verify that it
    is functioning) to check Status.WIP. Then add the capability to send
    a Write Enable command before clearing EEPromSysBusy. Test this by
    reading the 25LC256 Status register with polled code to check the
    state of the Write enable latch (Status.WEL) after the interrupt
    service completes (EEPromSysBusy == 0). Then move on to writing one
    byte and then writing n bytes and so on. <br>
    Then add functionality to support the ReadEEProm() function. Note
    that some things will be common to the WriteEEProm() functionality
    -- both need to read status first to make sure a write is not in
    progress, but reads don't have to do the enable write command, so
    some states can be skipped. For reads, the state that writes data
    can be modified, as appropriate, to write dummy data and save the
    returned data in the readbuffer array.<br>
    <br>
    Make sure that all interrupts the SPI will generate are handled
    before clearing EEPromSysBusy. <br>
    You can start out with a processor clock of 80 MHz and a SPI clock
    rate of 1MHz (as before). Then move to an SPI clock period that is
    as close as possible to 220ns for your final demonstration and
    before measuring the timing parameters.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Demonstrate</span> that 1, 2, 3 and
    64 bytes can be written at a time and that these writes will wrap
    within a random page. Precede the page write with a page read so we
    can show that the values actually changed.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-check, and record</span> the
    timing parameters for the 25LC256's <span style="text-decoration:
      overline;">CS</span> timing requirements looking for the minimums.
    (Note that you done have to check the setup and hold times again.)<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:
      bold;">Determine</span> as best you can the latency+execution time
    of your service routine for each its various states during a read.
    (Temporarily reduce the number of pieces of data read and written
    to/from the EEProm to make it easier to get through a whole
    read.)&nbsp; To do this, toggle a port pin in a loop that waits for
    EEPromSystemBusy to return to 0 following the call to ReadEEProm().
    Choose a port pin that we can see on the logic analyzer (i.e. RB2 --
    remember to set it for output and to configure it for digital I/O
    using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AD1PCFG</span> sfr). The
    latency+execution time will be marked by the periods of time that
    the pin is not toggling (+/- the loop execution time). Hopefully
    there is some toggling between each ISR state. This indicates that
    you are completing the ISR and returning to the main routine each
    time. If you do not see this each time, some of your ISR states are
    running too long. Try to streamline the code in the ISR states that
    are running too long so that you can see toggling between each
    state. If this can't be done, temporarily double your BRG. Note that
    this will not change the execution times of the ISR states, but it
    will make it possible to see what the latency+execution times are.
    Record the latency+execution times for each state of a Read sequence
    for your report.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Demonstrate </span>the logic
    analyzer output above to the professor.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report</span><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Include well commented, fully functional copies of the source
        code for both Part 1 and Part2. Also e-mail a copy of this code
        to the professor.</li>
      <li>Provide a more formal description of how your service routine
        functions in Part 2. This would employ a textual description of
        the overall functioning of your service routine <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> pseudo code or
        flow charts as appropriate in order to describe what is done in
        each state.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Look for instances in your <span style="font-weight: bold;">code</span>
        in Part 1&nbsp; where <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        was negated after polling RBF. Check the disassembly for this
        code segment (including any subroutines called) to verify that 8
        SYSCLKS are always between the RBF and the <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> negation. This
        would translate to having at least 7 machine instructions
        between the lw instruction that reads SPI1STAT and the sw
        instruction that sets <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        high.&nbsp; Provide copies of the C code segment(s) and
        its(/their) disassembly in your report (including the
        disassembly of called subroutines if appropriate). You need only
        give those segments of code that demonstrate the worst case
        (fewest instructions between RBF high and <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> high).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Repeat the above (report step 3 but this time for both parts
        of the lab), this time looking for instances where <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span> is negated then
        quickly (within 4 C instructions) asserted again. Verify that 4
        SYSCLKS elapse between <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        negation and <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        assertion.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Give the data recorded from the logic analyzer for data setup
        and hold and the three <span style="text-decoration: overline;">CS</span>
        timing parameters as required in Part 1 and Part 2.</li>
      <li>Give how many system clocks there are between an initial write
        to an empty SPI1BUF and when the TBE bit is set. Also report the
        method you used to determine this, and any uncertainties you
        identified.</li>
      <li>Report what was the minimum SPI clock period (down to 220ns
        minimum) at which you were able to operate in Part 2. At this
        clock period, determine how many system clock cycles would there
        be between SPI RX interrupts for continuous data reads. (Show
        your work).</li>
      <li>Report the latency+execution times you found for each state of
        a Read sequence. Compare your results from report question 7
        above to the latency+execution times. Are we gaining much of an
        advantage over polled code by using interrupts at this SPI clock
        rate?<br>
