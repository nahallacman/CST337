      <h3 style="text-align: center;">CST 337 Lab 3 -- Interrupts in C<br>
      </h3>
      <div style="text-align: left;">In this lab we will learn how to
        handle interrupts in C. Before we can handle interrupts in the
        PIC32MX, some things will have to be configured.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lab<br>
          <br>
        </span>1) Open a new project. Create a main program that doesn't
        do anything in particular except increment a variable or
        something. Set up the target board with the Real ICE debugger.
        (Remember to power up the RealICE before the target board). <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Set the debugger settings</span>
        (Tools &gt; Options &gt; Embedded &gt; Generic Settings) <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"Debug Startup" and "Reset @"
          both to "Reset vector"</span> so that the Reset will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> bring the
        debugger to the beginning of main but rather to the beginning of
        the C startup code -- crt.o. This means that the debugger will
        stop just after the processor resets. <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Reset and then set up watches
          as needed, or a CPU registers window (Window &gt; PIC Memory
          Views &gt; CPU) with bitfield mouseover in order to record
          values for the following fields in the "After Reset" line of
          the following table: <br>

          first executable line in main. Run to that point and record
          information for the "At beginning of main" line.<br>
          c) Also put your "After Reset" values in the table on the
          front desk in the lab. Once enough students have entered their
          data you can use this information to see which fields appear
          to have no defined reset value. Put X's in the "No apparent
          reset value" line for these fields.<br>
          d) Use the Family Reference manual to determine which of the
          above fields do in fact have no defined POR (power on reset)
          value. Put U's in the "No defined reset value" line for these
          fields.<br>
          e) The ERL bit in Status will appear to have a POR value of 1
          when the manual says it doesn't. Attempt to explain the
          discrepancy.<br>

        Record the filled in table and your answers to parts e through l
        for your report.<br>
        <br>
        2) Hopefully, you realized that you will have to either set or
        leave clear INTCON.MVEC (if you want single or multi-vector
        modes respectively.) and then enable interrupts. These are
        relatively easy to do yourself. Or you can use a predefined
        function. Take a look at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">INTEnableSystemMultiVectoredInt(










          )</span> function in C:\Program
        Files\Microchip\xc32\v1.32\pic32-libs\peripheral\int\source\int_enable_mv_int_lib.c.







        Be careful not to change it! (To use this peripheral library
        function in your code you will have to include &lt;plib.h&gt;.)<br>
        <br>
        What does this function assume? What bits does it set? Record
        your answers for your report.<br>
        <br>
        Note that it sets a bit that it does not need to. Ordinarily one
        would expect a library routine to take only care of things not
        already set up in initialization. Whenever you use library
        routines you need to be very aware of what it assumes, what it
        does and what side effects it might have! You also have to be
        aware of what the startup routines do.<br>
        <br>
        3) We will also need ways to set interrupt priority and sub
        priority in the appropriate IPCx register, and to (atomically)
        set and clear IF bits and IE bits.<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">m(xx)setIntPriority(priority)</span>
        is a set of macros that sets the priority for a selected
        peripheral specified in place of the (xx) . So <span style="font-weight: bold;">mT2setIntPriority(5)</span> would
        set the interrupt priority for Timer2 to 5. The flags used to
        replace (xx) are usually fairly obvious. These macros and the
        (xx) flags can be found in the C32 Peripheral Library Guide
        (pdf) in the Interrupt Macros section (Table 8-2). This file can
        be found on the class webpage. The pertinent macros are:<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">m(xx)SetIntPriority(priority)<br>
          m(xx)SetIntSubPriority(subpriority)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">m(xx)ClearIntFlag()</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">m(xx)IntEnable(enable) 0=
          disable, 1 = enable</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        </span>Note that there is no macro for m(xx)setIntFlag as this
        is not often done. The function of most of these macros can
        easily be done directly yourself, though you would have to look
        up which IFSx, IECx, and IPCx register and bits are needed. <br>
        <br>
        Check out the source for mT2ClearIntFlag() and
        mT2IntEnable(enable) in
        ...\xc32\v1.32\pic32-libs\include\peripheral\legacy\int_3xx_4xx_legacy.h.








        Are the IFSx and IECx bits set or cleared atomically? How do you
        know?<br>
        Record your answers for your lab report.<br>
        <br>
        4) Section 3.3 of the C32 C Compiler Guide in the C32 section of
        Help topics and in the XC32 docs (...\xc32\v1.32\docs\MPLAB XC32
        User Guide.pdf) provides insight on how to prototype and define
        interrupt service routines. One approach uses pragmas<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">#pragma
interrupt










            foo IPL4 vector 8</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">void foo (void)<br>
            <br>
          </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Another approach uses
        an interrupt and vector attributes in the function prototype for
        the interrupt service routine:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">void
__attribute__










            (( interrupt(IPL4),vector(8) )) foo (void)<br>
            <br>
          </span></div>
        Both of these approaches let the compiler know that foo is an
        interrupt service routine that is not passed any arguments and
        does not return any arguments and also informs the compiler of
        the interrupt priority level of the routine and where in the
        vector table a dispatch function targeting the handler should be
        placed. If IPL7 is specified, the compiler assumes that the
        service routine will be run at priority 7, and so it will use a
        shadow register set and therefore does not need to save any
        registers. Otherwise, the compiler will save and restore only
        the registers that the service routine uses. The IPLn specifier
        will generate code to set the IPL field in the CP0 register
        Status to the fixed value n. Since IPL7 assumes the shadow
        register set, it is clear that the IPLn specifier assumes a
        3xx/4xx PIC32 processor is being used, but as we saw in class,
        writes the prolog and epilog so that the code would be
        compatible with a 4xx/5xx/6xx processor. We must be careful to
        make sure that the actual priority of the interrupt set in the
        EIC IPCx register matches n in the IPLn specifier or we can have
        incorrect nesting of interrupts, which could result in a stack
        overflow and eventually a bus-error exception. Another IPL
        specifier option is RIPL. If we use this specifier, the compiler
        will put code in the prolog to determine the interrupt's
        requested priority from the Cause CP0 register (Cause.RIPL). As
        we saw in class this adds a few instructions to the prolog, but
        would not have the problem that a mismatched IPLn does. This is
        the only safe approach if we have a situation where the
        programmer wants to dynamically change an interrupt's priority
        by modifying IPCx registers <span style="font-style: italic;">during</span>
        runtime (rather than just at initialization).<br>
        <br>
        Other options for IPL specifiers which are appropriate to
        5xx/6xx/7xx processors are:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>IPLnSRS -- which sets the Status.IPL to n and assumes that
            priority level n is the one that gets the shadow set. <br>
          </li>
          <li>IPLnSOFT -- which sets the Status.IPL to n and saves and
            restores any registers the service routine uses (i.e. uses
            software context saving). <br>
          </li>
          <li>IPLnAUTO -- which sets the Status.IPL to n and looks at
            the SrsCtl CP0 register to determine if we have the shadow
            set or need to use software to save and restore any
            registers the service routine uses.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Setting the vector to 8 in the above example associates the
        interrupt handler with vector 8 (the vector for the Timer2
        interrupt). This means that code to jump to the interrupt
        handler will be placed in the 8th entry of the vector table. The
        8 in both the pragma and attribute statements can be replaced
        with a comma separated list of vector numbers which implies that
        interrupts from multiple vector sources would be handled by this
        interrupt handler. In the #pragma statement, if 8 is replaced
        with @8, then the interrupt handler itself is placed in the
        vector table itself at the 8th entry. (Note that the setting of
        IntCtl.VS is probably not large enough to allow this in our
        case). This function is accomplished in the attribute statement
        by replacing vector(8) with at_vector(8).<br>
        <br>
        I personally prefer the #pragma approach since it uses fewer
        underscores and brackets, but you can use what you like. Section
        13.3.3 of the XC32 Compiler User's Manual describes some macros
        that can be used to make the __attribute_ approach simpler.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>5) We will write
        some code to handle interrupts from Timer2. Set up the system
        and peripheral clocks for 72MHz operation. To do this you will
        have to change the config pragma for FPBDIV to DIV_1. Use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEMConfig(72000000L,
          SYS_CFG_WAIT_STATES | SYS_CFG_PCACHE)</span>function
        introduced in the last lab to remove unnecessary wait states and
        turn on caching. Set up timer 2 with a 1:1 prescale, to roll
        over and generate an interrupt every 512 counts (i.e. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">set PR2 to 511</span>).&nbsp;
        Add code to your main routine to initialize the interrupt system
        for multi-vectored interrupts . Note that you need to:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>First, turn off timer 2 and clear its interrupt flag.</li>
          <li>Then:<br>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>set up Multi-Vector mode, <br>
            </li>
            <li>establish the priority of the service routine (use <span style="font-weight: bold;">priority 4</span> and an<span style="font-weight: bold;"> IPL4</span> specifier).<br>
            </li>
            <li>globally enable interrupts (ei)<span style="font-weight:
                bold;"></span><br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">before </span>enabling the timer 2 interrupt
          (setting the appropriate IECx flag) and starting timer 2. <br>
          <br>
        </div>
        The order of the above items may vary depending on the functions
        you use to do these operations. Note that
        INTEnableSystemMultiVectoredInt( ) not only sets multi-vector
        mode, it also does an ei. Note that the PIC32MX automatically
        clears the IFSx, IECx and TxCON registers on power on reset (and
        Status.IE is cleared by the time we hit main), so strictly
        speaking, some of the above operations are not needed and the
        order of the others does not matter. But not all processors will
        do this for you, so it is good practice to get in the habit of
        following the above order which only assumes that interrupts are
        disabled on reset. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You will be
          graded on this point.</span><br>
        The general principle is to (early in the code) turn off devices
        that can generate interrupts and may have been on (not cleared
        at reset, or on from previous runs) and clear any pending
        interrupts that may have not been reset from previous runs
        before enabling individual interrupts and starting the device
        that can generate them. This way, the first interrupt comes from
        the intended event, not from previous events.<br>
        <br>
        Have the timer 2 service routine increment a counter (a global
        int), atomically clear the timer 2 interrupt flag and exit. Have
        the main routine just execute a <span style="font-family:
          monospace;">while(1);</span> loop. Note that you can use
        macros inside your service routine, <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">but do not make any calls to functions inside your
          service routine.</span> Function calls inside a service
        routine will require the prolog and epilog to save and restore <span style="font-weight: bold;">all </span>registers!<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
        </span> <br>
        6) Build, program and debug your code. You can set a watch on
        the counter and verify that it is incrementing up. Also set a
        breakpoint on the first C instruction in the service routine in
        order to verify that the service routine is being entered. When
        this breakpoint is triggered, read the Timer 2 value and record
        it for your report. This gives you an idea of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latency</span> of the interrupt
        since the interrupt was triggered when the timer rolled over to
        0. Demonstrate your running code to the professor. Reset the
        processor and then record the latencies for the first 10 times
        the service routine is entered. explain why the latency is
        different between the first time the service routine is entered
        and the subsequent times. Why might we not observe this behavior
        in other systems with more interrupts, or more extensive code
        running in the main routine?<br>
        <br>
        7) Using the disassembly view, determine what address (virtual)
        your interrupt handler is at. Using Ebase, IntCtl.VS and the
        vector number, determine what the address of the vector is. Open
        a Window &gt; PIC Memory Views &gt; Execution Memory (Code view)
        window. Right click on the window contents (anywhere except the
        leftmost column which also sets a breakpoint) and select "Go
        To". then select memory region and then select "Address". Now,
        supply the address of the vector you computed above. Determine
        what instructions are at the vector (it helps if the window
        format is "code"). Verify that the vector is jumping to your
        interrupt handler. Include your work and results for this part
        in your report.<br>
        <br>
        8) Clear all breakpoints, then set a breakpoint on the code at
        the interrupt vector itself. This can be done from the Execution
        Memory View (as noted above). Reset, then Run your code and
        determine the interrupt latency to this point. Record this
        latency for your report. Determine the difference between this
        latency and the first latency you found in part 6. How can you
        account for the difference between this latency and that
        recorded in part 6? What does the latency to this point
        represent? Run again. What is the latency to the breakpoint the
        second time? Why is it different from the first time?<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0,
            0);"><br>
            Note that it appears that having multiple breakpoints set
            for this part could change timer readings, so make sure to
            have only one breakpoint set.<br>
            <br>
          </span></span>9) Clear all breakpoints, then set a breakpoint
        on the opening curly brace of the service routine and one on the
        closing curly brace of the service routine. Using the
        disassembly view, determine where these breakpoints are actually
        set (relative to the start or end of the prolog or epilog).
        Record this for your report.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
          </span></span><br>
        10) Using the disassembly view determine what processor
        registers (not SFRs) are saved and restored by the interrupt
        handler's prolog and epilog. List them in your report.<br>
        <br>
        11) Set a breakpoint just after the last C instruction in the
        service routine and record the timer value at this point for
        both the first and second service routine entries after reset.
        Remove that breakpoint and set one on the eret instruction in
        the epilog and record the timer value at this point for both the
        first and second service routine entries after reset. What is
        the execution time of the epilog? Record your data and answer
        for your report.<br>
        <br>
        12) Change the handler's <span style="font-weight: bold;">priority










          to 7</span> and the&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">IPL










          specifier to 7</span> (the compiler will warn you that you
        should use IPL7SRS in the future), and repeat steps 6, 8 and 10.
        What differences do you observe and what accounts for them?
        Record your answer for your report.<br>
        <br>
        13) Change the Timer 2 handlers priority back to <span style="font-weight: bold;">priority 4</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">IPL4</span>. Add code to have Timer
        3 generate an interrupt every 1000 counts (otherwise use the
        same settings as for Timer2). Note that to get 1000 counts we
        will <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">set PR3 to 999</span>.
        Let this interrupt be handled at a lower priority. Have the
        Timer3 service routine increment a different global counter,
        clear the Timer 3 interrupt flag and exit. Build, program and
        debug your code and verify that both interrupts are being
        entered by watching both counters and/or setting breakpoints in
        the service routines.<br>
        Note, to get the two timers to be in sync with each other we
        could do something like<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
            monospace;">TMR2 = 0;</span><br style="font-family:
            monospace;">
          <span style="font-family: monospace;">TMR3 =
            3;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //
            Needed to get TMR2 and 3 in sync</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
          <span style="font-family: monospace;">T2CONSET = 0x8000; //
            Turn Timer 2 on then</span> <span style="font-family:
            monospace;">Turn Timer 3 on.</span><br style="font-family:
            monospace;">
          <span style="font-family: monospace;">T3CONSET = 0x8000; // Do
            not rearrange these lines so timers will sync </span><br>
        </div>
        Where setting TMR3 to 3 initially compensates for the fact that
        Timer 2 is turned on 3 machine instructions before timer 3 is
        turned on (check the disassembly to see that this is true). You
        can temporarily put a breakpoint on a dummy statement inside the
        while(1) loop and then check that the two timers have the same
        value to verify that they are in sync (have the same value) for
        a number of runs to this breakpoint. Note that after the first
        timer hits its period value that the two timers will no longer
        have the same value.<br>
        <br>
        14) In what order do you expect the service routines to be
        entered (for the first 8 times)? Record your prediction, Reset.
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Clear all other breakpoints, then set breakpoints on
            the first C instruction in each service routine</span></span>
        and Run. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Demonstrate this to
          the professor</span>. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>Record
        the order that the breakpoints were actually triggered.
        Since&nbsp; T3 interrupts at count 1000 and T2 interrupts at
        count 1024 (the second time it is triggered), why does it appear
        that T2 was entered before T3 in this case? Adding breakpoints
        to the opening curly braces of each service routine should help
        you understand what is going on.<br>
        <br>
        15) Add an infinite delay (while(1); loop) to the Timer 3
        service routine. Set breakpoints in both service routines.
        Verify that the Timer 3 service routine is entered only once,
        but that the Timer 2 service routine is entered multiple times
        indicating that the higher priority Timer 2 routine is nesting
        inside the Timer 3 routine <span style="font-weight: bold;">even









          though the Timer 3 service routine does not have an ei
          instruction</span> in it.<br>
        <br>
        16) Move the infinite delay to the Timer 2 service routine and
        verify that the Timer 3 service routine is not entered.<br>
        <br>
        17) Remove the infinite delay from the Timer 2 service routine,
        make Timer 3 have higher priority than Timer 2 (but not priority
        7) and add a delay of 40 counts to the Timer 3 service routine.
        To do this you can simply wait until Timer 3 &gt; 40 in the
        service routine itself. (Don't clear Timer 3 or otherwise adjust
        its value!). Build, program and debug, making sure both routines
        are still being entered. Set a breakpoint on the first C
        instruction in the Timer 2 service routine and clear all other
        breakpoints. Run, and record the latency on entry to the Timer2
        service routine for the first 10 times it is entered. Show your
        results to the professor. Report your results and explain, as
        best you can, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span>
        of the variations in the latency in your report. In particular
        -- <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Why are the second and 4th
          latencies significantly longer than the other latencies?<br>
          b) Why is the difference in the latency between the second and
          fourth latencies very close to 24?<br>
          c) Why is there a roughly 4 cycle variation in the 5th and
          subsequent latencies?<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        18)<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span>Make Timer 3
        have lower priority than Timer 2, but leave the delay in the
        Timer 3 routine.&nbsp; Will the Timer 2 service nest inside
        Timer 3 service? Can you determine a way to show that this is in
        fact happening? Demonstrate it to the professor and record your
        method for your report. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep a
          copy of your code at this point for your report.</span><br>
        <br>
        19) Change the interrupt mode to <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">single vector</span> and merge the two service routines
        into a single service routine that provides the same
        functionality as the original two service routines. Do not
        change the actual priority of the two timer interrupts, but set
        the IPL specifier to <span style="font-weight: bold;">RIPL</span>.
        Remember that in single vector mode, the EIC assigns vector 0 to
        all interrupts regardless of their priority or original vector
        number. Build program and debug, and verify that both timers are
        being serviced and that the interrupts are in fact nesting.
        Demonstrate this to the professor. <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Keep a copy of your code at this point for your report.</span><br>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>
        <ul>
          <li>Why was it necessary to set the IPL specifier to RIPL? <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Note that the compiler also supports the IPL specifier "single",
        but this will generate the same prolog and epilog as the RIPL
        specifier generates. Also, if no IPL specifier is given, the
        default behavior is the same as RIPL.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Since we know that
        Timer 2 service can nest inside Timer 3 service, the single
        service routine needs to be "<span style="text-decoration:
          underline;">re-entrant</span>". Code can be re-entrant if:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) It never modifies itself.
          That is, the instructions of the program are never changed.
          Ordinarily this is the case. Usually, the only time this comes
          up is if code is in modifiable memory (i.e. RAM) and the code
          accidentally overwrites itself (array or buffer overrun etc.).<br>
          b) Any variables changed by the routine must be allocated to a
          particular "instance" (i.e. nesting) of the routine's
          invocation. Thus, if a service routine is invoked for more
          than one interrupt, then the service routines variables must
          be unique to each instance of the service routine.</div>
