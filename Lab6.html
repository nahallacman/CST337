    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">During this lab we will will
      implement the interrupt driven service we talked about in class
      for the PIC32 UART. We will write two programs to test the
      functionality of the UART and of our service routine. The first
      program will help to develop and test basic functionality and the
      second program will build on the first. To keep things simple
      (from an analysis perspective), we will just use single character
      receive and transmit interrupts (interrupt on every character
      received and transmitted).<br>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>One ISR will be responsible for handling both UART receives
        and transmits. (Don't attempt to use a service routine for
        receives and the main routine for transmission or vice versa.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>The first program will cause the system to repetitively echo
        back on the RS232 output line any characters it receives on the
        RS232 input line. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>We



        will test this program by connecting the RS232 lines to a Com
        port on a PC running a terminal emulator program. When a
        character, is pressed on the PC's keyboard, the ASCII code for
        the character is transmitted out of the PC's UART on the line
        connected to the PIC32 UART1's RX input. This received character
        should then be repetitively sent back to the PC as fast as
        possible. That is, if an "A" is typed on the keyboard, the
        terminal emulator screen should begin to fill with "A"s. Before
        the first character is received, the PIC32 system should not
        transmit any characters. Your are required to do this up to
        115.2k baud. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The second program will cause the PIC32 system to continually
        store whatever it receives from the PC in an 8KiB buffer in the
        on chip RAM. If more data is received than there is room in the
        buffer, the new data should be discarded and an LED indicating
        buffer overflow (which is not UART overrun) should be lit.&nbsp;
        When the switch connected to RD10 (or RC1 on a version 1.5 AV32
        board) is pressed, the program will re-transmit everything it
        has buffered as well as clear the overrun LED. Don't assume that
        new data will be not sent to your system during the transmit
        phase -- the system must be able to receive and transmit
        simultaneously. Once all buffered data has been transmitted, the
        system will stop transmitting and wait for another RD10 switch
        press in order to tell it to start transmitting again (assuming
        more data has been received in the mean time). We will test this
        program by connecting your system to the serial port on a PC,
        and using a terminal emulator to perform ASCII text file uploads
        and downloads. We will adjust the terminal emulator's transfer
        settings so that characters are transmitted to your system at
        115.2k baud with 8 data bits and no parity and we will set it to
        use hardware (<span style="text-decoration: overline;">CTS</span>/<span style="text-decoration: overline;">RTS</span>) handshaking.
        Also, to begin with, have the UART service routine toggle one or
        both of two LEDS as appropriate each time it is entered. Let one
        LED represent receive activity and another LED indicate transmit
        activity (See Lab 1 for LED port pin assignments). <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color:
          rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span>Use one of the LED's on the PIC32MX
        starter kit board for the overrun LED.</li>
      <li>Finally, arrange to have the receive or transmit activity LEDs
        on solid (rather than toggling) when there is activity, and have
        them be on for a minimum of one half second. We can implement
        this with a timer for each LED. The UART service routine will
        reset the appropriate TMRx register and then turn on the
        appropriate LED. When the TMRx register matches its PRx register
        1/2 second later (assuming no intervening UART interrupts reset
        the TMRx register) the TMR interrupt service routine will turn
        off the LED. It would be appropriate to have the TMRx service
        routines at lower priority than the UART service routine. The
        TMRx service routine can also turn off the timer (which avoids
        the overhead of entering an interrupt service routine to turn
        off an LED that was already turned off) but in this case, we
        will need the UART service routine turn the timer on after
        resetting its TMRx register.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Notes<br>
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The AV-32 board differs from the Explorer 16 board you used in
        CST 204 in that it uses UART1 instead of UART2. This means that
        TX is on RF3, RX is on RF2, U1RTS is on RD15 and U1CTS is on
        RD14. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Arrange to have the system and peripheral clocks at 80MHz and
        to reduce the number of wait states for RAM and Flash and turn
        on the cache using SYSTEMConfig so the processor is operating as
        fast as possible.</li>
      <li>After determining what you need to do to set the baud rate
        generator, you might want to temporarily arrange to output the
        baud 16 clock on RD16 by setting the appropriate UEN bits in
        order to be able to check the baud clock frequency using an
        oscilloscope. Use the BRG and BRGH setting that gets you closest
        to 115.2 Kbaud.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Remember that the interrupt flags (IFS0.U1RXIF and
        IFS0.U1TXIF) need to be cleared <span style="text-decoration:
          underline;">atomically</span> in the service routine, or the
        system can fail. You can observe this by testing what happens
        when you clear IFS0.U1RXIF non-atomically in the first program.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Note that breakpoints can be problematic when debugging
        asynchronous communication. If the FRZ bit is on (default is on)
        then the UART freezes, even mid transmission or reception. This
        (freezing mid transmission) can confuse the receiver (the
        terminal emulator in this case) and it may need to be reset. If
        the UART doesn't freeze on breakpoint, you need to be aware that
        you can enter a service routine, send a character via single
        stepping, and have the character complete transmission (and set
        TXIF) before the time you execute the next instruction (which
        would not normally happen if the service routine was free
        running). <br>
      </li>
      <li>It is a good idea to build up slowly to the full functionality
        of the final program. In fact the first program is an
        intermediate step to developing the second program. It allows
        debugging interrupt control of transmissions and receptions in a
        simple environment. <br>
      </li>
      <li>If you use TXEN to control when program 2 transmits data, be
        aware that clearing TXEN turns TX pin to port control, and that
        by default port pins are inputs. Undriven lines are more
        susceptible to noise, which could potentially confuse the UART
        in the PC. Or, if the undriven TX line happens to go to a low
        level, then the PC's UART would see a break. To make sure this
        doesn't happen, you should set up the port pin so it is an
        output and driven high when the UART is not using it. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Program two requires you to use CTS/RTS handshaking. It is a
        good idea to check the CTS input to make sure it is okay to send
        data to the terminal emulator on the PC so we don't overrun it
        if the PC becomes busy. Note that CTS is asserted low. We can
        either check the CTS input in the transmit service routine
        before sending more characters, or turn on CTS checking by the
        UART hardware though the UEN bits in U1MODE. If this is done the
        UART hardware will automatically suspend transmissions while CTS
        is not asserted. This latter approach is probably more desirable
        in an interrupt driven approach, because we don't want to get
        stuck in a polling loop inside the service routine waiting for
        CTS to be asserted. (We could have the main routine check to see
        if transmissions have paused, and then wait for CTS to be
        asserted upon which it could set TXEN to restart transmissions,
        or we could possibly arrange for assertion of CTS to trigger an
        interrupt that would restart transmissions with TXEN, but these
        approaches are not needed since the hardware approach is
        available in this case.) Turning on automatic control of CTS
        also turns on automatic control of RTS. In this case, RTS is
        asserted low whenever the receive buffer is not full, and when
        OERR (overrun error) is not set -- that is whenever the UART is
        ready to receive. (For this behavior to be true, the UART must
        be in Flow control mode U1MODE.RTSMD = 0). For more information
        on RTS and CTS, see section 21.11 of the Family Reference
        manual. Your program should be fast enough so that RTS never has
        to be cleared. We will check this pin on the scope to see if it
        ever is.</li>
      <li>Program two requires using the switch connected to RD10. This
        switch reads low when pressed, and it is bouncy so it will need
        to be debounced in software. This can be done by waiting until
        the port shows 0 for two or three successive reads that are 15ms
        apart. (Most "good" switches will bounce for no more than about
        11ms.) Also note that we should check for the switch to return
        to 1 for two successive reads 15ms apart before looking for 0
        again to indicate that the next transmission should begin. We also
        should not check for a switch press while transmitting since we
        do not want the main routine to attempt to initiate transmission
        a second time while the service routine is still transmitting
        the buffer.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Arrange to find a way to time the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">latency</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">execution time</span> of
        the second program's service routine (including prolog time in
        the latency and epilog time in the execution time) on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">character receive</span>.
        One way to do this would be to temporarily have the main routine
        set the RXIF flag. Set a stopwatch start on the set of the RXIF
        and a stopwatch stop on the first instruction (after the prolog)
        of the service routine. In a second run, set a stopwatch start
        on the first instruction of the service routine and a stopwatch
        stop on the instruction following the one that set the RXIF flag
        in the main routine. Make sure the processor is operating as
        fast as possible before collecting this data. Also collect the
        data after a reset so that the uncached latency and execution
        time will be obtained.<br>
      </li>
      <li>It is always a good idea to check the compatibility of RS232
        connectors and pinouts whenever we connect two systems together.
        See the figures below. Notice how flow control mode is used for
        RTS and CTS and how outs are always connected to ins and
        vice-versa.

following




          figure shows the pinout and connections of the SN65c3232 modem
          chip on the AV 32 board. This chip translates the 3.3V logic
          levels out of the PIC32MX UART to RS232C line levels sent to
          the PC and translates RS232C line levels received from the PC
          to 3.3V logic levels for the PIC32MX UART. The pins are not
          shown in order. The chip is a 16 pin SOIC, and only the left
          side is visible and accessible just under the bottom right
          edge of the PIC32 starter kit board. Of the pins that are
          accessible, only pins 7 and 8 are usable. Note that these pins
          are RS232C line level signals and so they <span style="font-weight: bold;">should not be connected to the
            Logic Analyzer</span> (it doesn't handle negative voltages
          well) but they can be probed with the oscilloscope. The
          TTL(CMOS) level UART signals connected to the PIC32 are also
          connected to the AV32 board's J6 connector. Pin assignments
          for signals on the AV32 board's J5 and J6 connectors can be
          found on the class web page at <a href="http://www.cset.oit.edu/~lynnd/cst337/AV32.html">AV32


            J5 and J6 Pinout</a>. These signals are okay to monitor on

      Note that there are two cases in which h == t, one when num_items
      == max and the buffer is full and one when num_items = 0 and the
      buffer is empty. Note that there are other algorithms for these
      operations. One algorithm uses "full" and "empty" flags instead of
      counting items. Another algorithm never lets h == t in which case
      we never have to count the number of items, but this leaves one
      entry in the buffer unusable.<br>

      <li>A brief conclusions section in which you:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Report on the successes, failures and difficulties you
          encountered when performing both procedures in this
          experiment.</li>
        <li>Report the system clock and peripheral bus clock frequencies

        <li>Justify your choice of BRG and BRGH.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Report the latency and execution time associated with a
          single character receive as measured in part 10 above.
          Describe how you measured it.<br>

        <li>Report on the performance of your second program in terms of
          how fast (i.e. at what baud rate) it can receive&nbsp; and
          send data. State how fast it actually performed as tested, and
          how fast it should be able to theoretically perform based on
          the latency and execution times measured in part 10 above.<br>
