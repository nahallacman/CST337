    <h3 style="text-align: center;">CST 321/337 Lab 1 -- Introduction to
      C on the PIC32MX<br>
    </h3>
    During this lab we will will look at some introductory concepts
    related to using C to program at lower levels. We are only going to
    do some basic programming in terms of simply flashing LEDs using
    polled timing, but we can use this to introduce using C on the
    PIC32MX and some ideas relating to how C statements relate to the
    machine code and how this can affect performance.<br>
    <br>
    We will begin by writing a simple program to turn one (or several)
    of the LEDs on and off. The PIC32 Starter kit has LEDs at RD0, RD1
    and RD2. The AV32 Companion board, in which the starter kit is
    mounted, also has two more LEDs -- at RB9 and RB8 on version 1.4(B
    and C) <u>or</u> at RB4 and RB5 on version 1.5. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      The Lab<br>
      <br>
    </span>1) See the MPLab setup notes section below for a refresher on
    setting up the MPLab software and bringing up the source editor.<br>
    <br>
    2) Change the "#include &lt;p32xxxx.h&gt;" statement to "#include
    &lt;xc.h&gt;" statement to the file. (Note that you could leave the
    include as p32xxxx.h as it mainly just includes xc.h itself.) Based
    on the device we selected in the project wizard, this include file
    will select the appropriate include file to provide names for the
    various processor resources. In our case this is C:\Program
    Files\Microchip\xc32 \v1.32\pic32-libs\include\proc\p32mx360f512l.h
    .&nbsp; (In the future, Microchip may add a "new file" category for
    the XC32 compiler that adds the xc.h include automatically.)<br>
    <br>
    3) Open p32mx360f512l.h with an appropriate editor (i.e. notepad++)
    but <span style="font-weight: bold;">be careful not to make or save
      any changes!</span> Search for PORTD. Note how it is defined as an
    "extern volatile unsigned int". The "extern" means its address is
    defined elsewhere (in the sfrs section). The "volatile" means that
    the contents of the SFR may be changed in ways the compiler cannot
    be aware of (which is appropriate for sfrs since they are attached
    to I/O devices). Assuming the include file is accurate, the resource
    names defined here should be the same as those used in the Family
    Reference Manual and Datasheets. Note how a typedef of a union of
    two bit field structs is defined for PORTDbits. Thus, PORTDbits.RD0
    can be used to reference bit 0 of port D and PORTDbits.w can refer
    to all 32 bits -- as can PORTD alone. Also note how similar
    definitions are provided for LATD and TRISD and how definitions are
    provided for PORTDSET, PORTDCLR and PORTDINV and the set clear and
    invert addresses for TRISD and LATD etc. <br>
    Note that many of the peripherals, including PORTD, are actually 16
    bit devices (to be backward/hardware compatible with earlier 16 bit
    PICS) but they are still defined as 32bit ints. There is no issue
    with this on this processor since all device addresses are aligned
    to 32 bit addresses and with a 32 bit bus, there is no loss of
    performance in writing or reading&nbsp; an aligned 32 bit value as
    opposed to a 16 bit value. (We will talk more about alignment later
    on in lecture.)<br>
    (By the way, while bitfields are appropriately defined in
    p32mx360f512l.h, such definitions should generally be avoided in
    your own code. The order of bitfields (LSB first or MSB first) is
    hardware dependent, so code with bitfields in it is not portable.
    p32mx360f512l.h is obviously used for specific hardware and so, by
    definition it is not intended to be portable!)<br>
    <br>
    4) Search further down p32mx360f512l.h for .extern PORTD. This
    statement is further needed by the linker to resolve the external
    address for PORTD. Note how its address is shown using a comment.
    Note that this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span>
    define the address, it is just there for our convenience. The
    address assignment is actually done in an object file
    (...\xc32\v1.32\pic32mx\lib\proc\32mx360f512l\processor.o) for which
    we don't have the source code. The ultimate authority for SFR
    addresses is the Datasheet.<br>
    <br>
    5) Though I'm fairly sure all SFRs have already been given symbolic
    names, assume that one wasn't defined, or that it was defined
    wrongly. How could we access it? (Also, other processor's
    development environments may not provide these resources.) Consider
    the following approaches to defining and referencing myportD --<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace;">volatile
        unsigned int * myportD;<br>
        <br>
        myportD = 0xBF8860D0; /* setting up the address */<br>
        *myportD |= 1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*
        referencing PORTD */<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      b)<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">#define myportD (* (volatile unsigned int *)
          0xBF8860D0)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
        <br style="font-family: monospace;">
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">myportD |= 1;</span><br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    Note how the second approach should result in less code and storage
    space than the first approach, though both may ultimately end up
    generating the same amount of code, <span style="text-decoration:
      underline;">if</span> compiler optimization is available and
    turned on.<br>
    <br>
    6) Search down further in p32mx360f512l.h for _PORTD_RD0_MASK and
    note how mask positions and lengths are defined for all the PORT
    bits.<br>
    <br>
    7) Finish writing the program to toggle an LED bit. First, use
    statements like PORTD |= 1 and PORTD &amp;= ~1 to toggle the LED
    (assuming we want to toggle the LED on RD0). Structure your program
    to toggle the LEDs in an infinite while loop. We will test it by
    using the simulator and a watch on the port (or ports) containing
    the LEDS.<br>
    Note that you want to structure your code so that only the port pins
    connected to the LEDs are configured for output (remember TRIS?).
    You don't want to inadvertently configure a port pin for output that
    is already connected to the output of another device, creating a
    conflict and potentially damaging either the other device or the
    PIC32. <br>
    Also note that PORTB defaults to analog inputs for the A/D
    converter. To use these pins for LEDS (if you want to use PORTB
    LEDs) you will need to configure the pins for digital I/O using the
    AD1PFCG sfr. (See section 17 of the Family Reference Manual.)<br>
    <br>
    8) Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Simulator</span>
    tool from the Hardware tools pane in the Project Properties window
    (File &gt; Project Properties or Right click on the project name in
    the Project window and select Properties or the wrench button in the
    Dashboard). Next, compile and debug your code (Debug Project icon).
    Note that first setting the "Debug Startup" option to "Main" as
    described below will cause the Debug Project Icon to stop execution
    at the first instruction in main rather than proceeding directly to
    running (simulating in this case) your code. If you didn't do this,
    then your code is now running (simulating). If this is the case,
    clicking the pause button will stop your code and highlight the line
    in your code that will be executed next (assuming it hasn't already
    exited). The Reset (Reset Icon) will (by default) reset device to
    the beginning of main.<br>
    <br>
    9) Note (as illustrated in the output window) that during the build,
    all .c files added to the project are compiled to object (.o) files
    using xc32-gcc. Then xc32-gcc is used to link all the object files
    just created and any that were added to the project directly (these
    would appear in the object files list of the Project window). It
    also searches libraries for any library routines that were used in
    the project. Both libraries explicitly added to the project (Library
    Files in the Project window) and standard libraries (see the gcc
    command line in the output window) are linked. The linker is guided
    by the default linker script
    "...\xc32\v1.32\pic32mx\lib\proc\32mx360f512l\procdefs.ld". This
    file contains the reference to processor.o that contains the sfr
    address definitions as well as memory region (i.e. Flash and SRAM)
    sizes and interrupt and exception vector addresses. Should we need
    to provide additional instructions to the linker this can be done
    through a .ld file added to the project (in the Linker Files section
    of the Project window). Finally a binary format file (.elf) is
    produced and loaded. <br>
    <br>
    10) Open the Watch window (Window &gt; Debugging &gt; Watches) and
    right click in the window to add a new watch or do Debug &gt; New
    Watch) and add the PORTD SFR. Single step through the LED set and
    clear statements to verify that the bit(s) are being properly set
    and cleared. Note that you can also right click on a variable or SFR
    reference in your code and select "New Watch".<br>
    <br>
    11) Open the disassembly window (Window &gt; Debugging &gt;
    Disassembly) and observe the code that was generated for the LED set
    and clear statements. Record this for the next step. Also note how
    "Step Into" stepping when the source window is highlighted steps C
    instruction lines, while "Step Into" stepping while the disassembly
    window is highlighted steps assembly level instructions. "Step Over"
    stepping while the disassembly window is highlighted steps C
    instruction lines. Observe how the set statement was implemented in
    the disassembly and record this for your report. (Window &gt; PIC
    Memory Views &gt; Execution Memory also shows the encoding of the
    instructions which can sometimes be helpful.)<br>
    <br>
    12) Change the LED set statement to one that looks like
    PORTDbits.RD0 = 1 and the LED clear statement to one that looks like
    PORTDbits.RD0 = 0. Then rebuild and debug your code (to make sure it
    works). Observe how the set statement was implemented in the
    disassembly and record it for your report. Is the implementation
    substantially different than what you saw in step 11? How does it
    differ? How many instructions are used and how many time is an SFR
    referenced in each case? Record this for your report. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure that you always stop the
      debugger before making code changes and running a new debug
      session, or you may end up getting bad results!</span> Note that
    you will have to re-open the disassembly window since the debugger
    stop will close it. This is to make sure the disassembly stays in
    sync with the source. You should usually never have more than one
    "(Build, Load, ...)" output window.<br>
    <br>
    13) Change the LED set statement to one that looks like PORTDSET = 1
    debug your code (to make sure it works). Observe how the set
    statement was implemented in the disassembly and record it for your
    report. Is the implementation different than what you saw in steps
    11 and 12? What are the differences and why? How many instructions
    are used and how many times is an SFR referenced in this case?&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span>Record this for your
    report. Note that PORTDINV=1 can be used to perform both the set and
    clear functions.<br>
    <br>
    14) Now add a delay based on polling Timer2 to your infinite loop to
    allow the LED to be on and off for 1/4 second. Assume a 72MHZ system
    clock and a 36MHZ peripheral bus clock. Refer to the PIC32 Family
    Reference manual (Section 14) as needed to set up Timer2. Note that
    Timer2 is a type B timer. Configure it for 16 bit ungated operation.
    Note that microchip recommends turning off the timer by setting the
    TON bit in T2CON to 0, then setting the initial values of TMR2, PR2
    and other bits in T2CON as needed, then setting TON to start the
    timer.<br>
    <br>
    15) Note that if you attempt to simulate the adjusted code with a
    1/4 second delay in it, single stepping is out of the question. Even
    setting a breakpoint after the delay loop and running to that point
    will take a very long time since the simulator does not run in real
    time. Temporarily reduce the delay, and use a breakpoint to make
    sure your modified code is reaching the LED toggle statement(s).<br>
    (Breakpoints can be set by single clicking on the line number to the
    right of the line where you want to set the breakpoint.)<br>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><br>
    16) How do we check, using the simulator, that our delays are
    correct? Open the StopWatch tab (Window &gt; Debugging &gt;
    StopWatch). The stopwatch records the number of system cycles
    between breakpoints. Run to the breakpoint a couple of times. What
    is the default simulated system clock frequency? This value can be
    changed in the debugger settings window (Project Properties &gt;
    Simulator &gt; Oscillator Options) but only after stopping the Debug
    session. Run one pass of the loop (LED toggle to LED toggle) and
    determine the time of the delay in cycles -- record the stopwatch
    value (in cycles) and the simulated processor frequency. Using this
    information, determine what the simulator's default clock division
    is for the Peripheral Bus Clock (PBCLK). Record&nbsp; your data,
    work and your answer to this question for your report. (That is,
    show your work in your report). Also report what delay, in TMR2
    clocks, you were attempting to implement at this point. <br>
    <br>
    17) Before we run the code in actual hardware, we have to be careful
    to take care of the system and peripheral bus clocks. The following
    table shows the setup needed for a 72MHz system clock and 36MHz
    peripheral clock. The Configuration bits registers are stored in the
    boot flash of the PIC32. These registers are read during reset to
    determine the initial settings of the clock oscillators (and other
    things). <br>
    To set the system clock for 72MHz operation we select the 8MHz
    external crystal (XT osc mode for Primary Oscillator and Primary Osc
    w/PLL (XT+/etc) for Oscillator Selection, divide this down to 4 MHz
    for the PLL (PLL Input divider set to 2x Divider), multiply the 4MHz
    PLL input by 18 to get a 72MHz system clock out of the PLL (18x PLL
    Multiplier) and finally get the 72MHZ system clock by not dividing
    the PLL output (System PLL Output Clock divider set to 1). Setting
    the Peripheral Clock divisor to 2 gives us the 36 MHz PBCLK. <br>

    18) The values to program in the configuration registers can be set
    by #pragmas in the code itself. This is a good idea since clock
    settings are often integral to a project and not having the clock
    settings be recorded in the source code can lead to problems down
    the road. The following settings provide the same settings as noted
    in part 17 above.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">#pragma config POSCMOD=XT,
      FNOSC=PRIPLL, FPLLIDIV=DIV_2, FPLLMUL=MUL_18, FPLLODIV=DIV_1<br>
      #pragma config FPBDIV=DIV_2, FWDTEN=OFF, CP=OFF, BWP=OFF</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">#pragma config FSOSCEN=OFF,
      IESO=OFF</span><br>
    <br>
    Note that not all fields need be specified. We only need specify the
    fields that differ from the default values. In the above table,
    those settings we change are indicated in black. Those that don't
    need pragmas because their default value is already okay are shown
    in red.<br>
    <br>
    Add the above pragmas to your code and re-make it.<br>
    <br>
    19) The Configurations Bits window (Window &gt; PIC Memory Views
    &gt; Configuration bits) shows the current configuration bits
    settings. Open this window and verify that the settings, including
    the defaults given in the table above are set. Now, re-run the code
    with the stopwatch as before. Does the simulator appear to take the
    configurations bits into account or not? How do you know? Also check
    to see if any changes were made in the oscillator options of the
    Debugger settings.&nbsp; Record these observations for your report.<br>
    <br>
    Note that changes can be made in the configurations bits window, but
    that this does not automatically make changes to the pragmas in your
    code. However, the "Generate Source Code to Output" button in this
    window can create code that you can cut and paste into your source
    code.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    20) Before going to actual hardware we will experiment with the
    Simulator's Logic Analyzer. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Under Project Properties &gt; Conf:Simulator &gt; (Option
        Category) Trace , select "Instruction Trace" for the Data
        Collection Selection. Also select Reset Data File on Run. Note:
        the debugging session needs to be stopped before doing this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Select Window &gt; Simulator &gt; Analyzer</li>
      <li>Click the "Edit pin channel definitions" button (it uses a
        chip icon). In the "Add/Remove Pins" window that opens, select
        the port output pin that you are toggling, and add it to the
        Selected Pins list. Then click OK.</li>
      <li>Remove any breakpoints from your code and run then halt the
        simulation after a pause (long enough to have the LED toggle
        several times).</li>
      <li>The Logic Analyzer window should show a square wave. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note that You may need to adjust you delay amount and/or the
        trace buffer size (File &gt; Project Properties &gt;
        Conf:Simulator &gt; Trace) in order to see the square wave.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show the result to the professor.</span><br>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
    </span>21) Make sure the configuration bits are set as indicated in
    part 18. Connect up the Real ICE emulator and the target hardware
    following instructions given by the professor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember to always power up the ICE
      before the target hardware (and when shutting down to turn off the
      target hardware before turning off the ICE)</span>. Select the
    Real ICE as the debugger hardware. Reset your timer delay to the
    right value. Re build your project and program the target hardware.
    Reset and run. Observe that the LED(s) toggle as required. Debug as
    needed. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Demonstrate your running
      program.</span> Use the Stopwatch to time one iteration of the
    loop. When Real ICE is the debugger there must be two breakpoints
    for the stopwatch function. One will start the stopwatch and the
    other will stop it. Set one breakpoint on the LED Set statement and
    the other on the LED Clear statement. Using the properties button in
    the Stopwatch tab, select one breakpoint for the start condition and
    the other for the stop condition,&nbsp; From the system cycle count,
    does it appear that there is 1/4 second between LED toggles? Record
    your results, including any calculations, for your report. Also in
    your report, explain, as best you can any discrepancies between the
    value reported to you by the stopwatch and the value you would have
    expected on the stopwatch. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note
      that the Real ICE stopwatch is a 24 bit timer so it may roll over
      depending on your delay settings</span>. (I'm not sure how many
    bits are available in the simulator's stopwatch, but it appears to
    be more than 32.)<br>
    <br>
    22) In the breakpoint tab (Window &gt; Debugging &gt; Breakpoints)
    right click on a breakpoint and select Customize. Then experiment
    with the "pass count" options. What does this do?&nbsp; Also note
    that the Debug &gt; New breakpoint dialog (or right click in the
    Breakpoints Tab) allows you to set breakpoints on Data (data memory
    accesses) Address (instruction or data reference to an address) or
    various other system Events. Right clicking on a variable name in
    the code window also lets you set data breakpoints. Experiment with
    data breakpoints to see if this works for both global and local
    variables and for SFRs. Record the results for your report. Observe
    the disassembly window while running to these breakpoints along with
    choosing "break on read", "break on write" and "break on read or
    write" options for them. <br>
    Note that with local variables you will have to supply the
    variable's address which you can get by hovering over the variable
    in the code window, or through the watch window.&nbsp; To get the
    correct address requires that the variable be "in scope" meaning
    that you have to be <u>inside</u> the routine that declares it (at
    least on the first executable line inside "main" in this case). Be
    careful whenever you re-compile since the variable's address could
    change but the data breakpoint would have the old address! <font color="#ff0000">Also, do not type anything in the Symbol box in
      the set breakpoint dialog! This appears to be a bug. This same bug
      also apples to SFRs. You can use the Symbols button to select an
      SFR for a data breakpoint and get its address, but then clear the
      SFR name from symbol box and change the first Hex digit of the
      address from a 1 to a B.</font><br>
    Note that you can also set Sequential breakpoints (run till the
    first breakpoint in a sequence is triggered, then look for the next
    breakpoint) and Anded breakpoints (break only when a code breakpoint
    and a data breakpoint are triggered) through the Breakpoints dialog.
    This is accomplished through right clicking on a breakpoint in the
    breakpoints tab and selecting "Complex Breakpoint".<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>
    </span><br>
    23) Right Click in the watches tab and add "runtime" watches on TMR2
    and on a local or global variable that also has a regular watch on
    it.&nbsp; What is the difference between a regular and a runtime
    watch? From your observations of the output of the runtime watch for
    TMR2, how do you think the runtime watch works? Why might this slow
    down the real-time execution of the target hardware?<br>
    <br>
    24) Determine the difference between software and hardware
    breakpoints. You can use the Real ICE user's guide on the class
    webpage for information about this. In your report, record how many
    software and hardware data and instruction breakpoints are available
    in the PIC32MX under Real ICE. You can find some of this information
    on the Dashboard under Resources. Software breakpoints can be
    enabled under Project Properties &gt; Real ICE &gt; Debug Options or
    with the resources button in the Dashboard. Why, as reported in the
    Real ICE User's guide, does using software breakpoints impact
    "device endurance"? Include your answers in your report.<br>
    <br>
    25) Power down the target board, then the Real ICE and return to the
    simulator. The Simulator's Trace function (that was used to do the
    logic analyzer earlier) is used primarily to allow code execution to
    be traced. Turn tracing on as described in item 20 above. You might
    also want to shorten the delay loop. Run one pass of the loop and
    look at the results in the Trace window. (Note that right clicking
    on the trace window provides an option to clear the trace buffer).
    By examining the trace window, determine what each of the SA, SD,
    S2A, S2D, DA and DD headings in the Trace window mean. Record your
    answer for the report. Note that the Real ICE can also trace, but
    extra hardware setup is required to support this.<span style="color:

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report<br>
    </span><br>
    A formal report is not required, simply turn in the following items.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a copy of your final (commented) source code.</li>
      <li>Provide complete answers to the questions posed in and results
        from each of parts 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 22,&nbsp; 23, 24 and 25.</li>
      <li>Also answer the following questions:<br>
      </li>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">26) Why doesn't the PORTDSET sfr
        have bit definitions (say bit0, bit1 etc) in p32mx360f512l.h
        like PORTD (has RD0, RD1 etc)? In other words, <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Why does PORTDSETbits.bit0 =
          1 not make any sense? <br>
          b) What is wrong with the statement PORTDSET |= 1? (Hint,
          check what the Family Reference Manual says will be returned
          from the PORTxSET/INV/CLR registers). </div>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> 27) We note that the linker will
        link your code to the startup code crt.o. This code provides
        some system initialization related to (among other things)
        setting up the interrupt environment along with setting initial
        values for variables.&nbsp; You may not want to have your code
        be linked to crt.o, in which case you would provide your own
        system initialization and initialization for variables. This is
        known as runtime initialization. Why do variables in an embedded
        system need to be initialized at "runtime"? Note that general
        purpose systems (i.e. PCs) rely on "load time" initialization
        for variables. "Load time" is when the program (including code
        and initialized data) is loaded from disk into RAM.

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">MPLAB setup notes:</span><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open MPLABX<br>
      </li>
      <li>Launch a new project from the File menu or from the start page<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>In step 1, select&nbsp; "Standalone Project" from the
          "Microchip Embedded" category.<br>
        </li>
        <li>In step 2, select the PIC32MX360F512L device from the 32-bit
          MCUs (PIC32) family.</li>
        <li>In step 3, select the Real ICE development tool.</li>
        <li>In step 5, (4 is automatically skipped) keep the default (no
          optional plugin board&nbsp; selected).<br>
        </li>
        <li>In step 6, select (highlight) the XC32 compiler toolchain:X
          C32 (v1.32) [C:\Program Files\Microchip\xc32\v1.32\bin]<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
        </li>
        <li>In step 7, select a project name and browse to create a new
          folder on your Z drive. Check the "set as main project" box.
          Note that you can create a folder on the C drive, and project
          building might be faster if you do, but that anything stored
          on the C drive will be lost at the end of the day (or if the
          machine must be rebooted). So, if you use the C drive you will
          have to copy files to and from your Z drive (or another
          storage device) each time you use the lab.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Create a new C source file by using CTRL+N, or File &gt; New.
        Then, in step 1, choose the "main.c" file type from the
        "Microchip Embedded &gt; C32 Compiler"category. In step 2 choose
        an appropriate file name. You likely won't need to select a new
        folder. Make sure to use a ".c" extension. This should create a
        c source file with a header comment, an #include
        &lt;p32xxxx.h&gt; statement and an empty main prototype. It
        should also add the file as a source file in your project, check
        this in the Projects window (Window &gt; Projects).<br>
      </li>
      <li>I recommend setting the "Debug Startup" option under Tools
        &gt; Options &gt; Embedded &gt; Generic Settings to "Main".
        Otherwise the debugger will start you code in run mode.
        Alternately you can make sure to set an appropriate breakpoint
        before starting the debugger. You might also set "Reset" to Main
        as well.<br>
      </li>
